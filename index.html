            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm Lenishemarie, also known as Lola Lopez, an illustrator based in New York City. 
                My artistic approach is dynamic and versatile, emphasizing texture while navigating through various styles. 
                I specialize in diverse subjects with a particular focus on surreal art.
                <br>
                Beyond personal projects, I offer illustrations tailored for editorials and 
                other specific needs. My work draws inspiration from life experiences, with a deliberate 
                emphasis on themes related to mental health and fantasy.
